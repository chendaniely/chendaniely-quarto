::: {#hero-heading}

Iâ€™m a data science educator who loves teaching and inspiring others to learn, explore, and create with code.
My research focuses on how we teach and learn data science programming in medical and biomedical contexts.
My community work is grounded in open source collaboration and a deep commitment to data literacy, because I believe coding is a core skill for empowerment and meaningful change.
